# Stiri si Pacanele

- Stiri si Pacanele is a Next.js starter kit built to help you get your project off the ground faster so you can focus less on the tedious setup and more on building incredible experiences for your users.
- Stiri si Pacanele aims to provide a minimal set of feautures and examples that you can use to expand into your own projects and customize to fit your needs.

- This project is inspired by shadcn's Taxonomy project (https://tx.shadcn.com/).

- I would also like to thank Theo (https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) and the T3 community (https://create.t3.gg/) for their amazing open-source work. They have all motivated and inspired me to start building!

   - If you do not have pnpm installed, follow the directions here: https://pnpm.io/installation.
2. Setup the database
   - `cd packages/db` - Go to the database package.
   - `cp .env.example .env` - Copy the environment.
     - Follow the instructions in the `.env` file to setup a database with PlanetScale or Docker.
3. Setup the website
   - `cd apps/web` - Go to the Next.js website app.
   - `cp .env.example .env` - Copy the environment.
     - Follow the instructions in the `.env` file to setup all of the required environment variables.
